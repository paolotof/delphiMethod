\f0\fs24 \cf0 I used as a template the Mike Bostock's code to make a barchart. The function d3.scaleBand allows painless display of categorical variables. This is ideal in my case since the responses varies between 1 and 10. d3.scaleBand() is also very flexible because it allows to display all the range of possible answer even if a given item did not receive a single response. I found this very flexible because it entails that all plots will be displayed with the same (horizontal, x) scale. This is important because representation with the same scale allows a straightforward comparison of multiple graphs when they are presented together. }
